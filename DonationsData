--Throughout this data exploration, we have delved into the analysis of donation data and subscriber information 
--to gain valuable insights and answer key questions. Our investigation involved querying the database to retrieve 
--relevant information and performing calculations to derive meaningful metrics. 

-- 1. First I run a query for both tables given to do an initial analysis of the data: 

SELECT * FROM donations
LIMIT 10

SELECT * from subscribers
LIMIT 10

-- 2. Determine the total number of members in the organization to gain an understanding of the membership size. 
-- This provides a foundational metric for further analysis and decision-making.

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT organizationmemberid) AS TOTAL_MEMBERS
  FROM subscribers 
-- The total members are 23896
  
--3. Visualize the number of members who made donations during the month of August.

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT organizationmemberid) AS August_Donors
FROM donations
WHERE paymentdate like '8%';
-- The total number of members who made donations during August is 1529

-- 4. Generate a table that presents key metrics including the total number of members in the organization,
-- the number of members who made donations during the month of August, and the proportion of August donors 
-- relative to the total number of members. This analysis allows for a comprehensive understanding of member engagement.

    SELECT 
      COUNT(DISTINCT s.organizationmemberid) AS Total_Members,
      COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN d.paymentdate LIKE '8%2018' 
      THEN d.organizationmemberid END) AS August_Givers,
      ROUND(COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN d.paymentdate LIKE '8%2018' 
      THEN d.organizationmemberid END) * 100.0 / COUNT(DISTINCT s.organizationmemberid), 2) AS Proportion
    FROM subscribers s
    LEFT JOIN donations d ON s.organizationmemberid = d.organizationmemberid;

-- During the month of August, the organization had a total of 1,529 donors, representing approximately 6.4% of 
-- the total membership base. This indicates a certain level of engagement and support from the members during that period.


--4. Also I could analyze the three months of available data and observe the percentage difference from 
--one month to the previous month: 

SELECT 
  CASE
    WHEN paymentdate LIKE '7%' THEN 'July'
    WHEN paymentdate LIKE '8%' THEN 'August'
    WHEN paymentdate LIKE '9%' THEN 'September'
  END AS month,
  COUNT (DISTINCT organizationmemberid) AS Unique_donors,
  ROUND(COUNT(organizationmemberid) * 100.0 / (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT organizationmemberid) FROM subscribers), 2) AS Proportion_of_Total,
  ROUND((COUNT(organizationmemberid) * 100.0 / LAG(COUNT(organizationmemberid), 2) OVER (ORDER BY paymentdate) - 100), 2) AS Perc_Var_Previous_Month
FROM donations
GROUP BY month
ORDER BY paymentdate;

-- We got the following results: 

--        Unique donors    Proportion of Total     Perc Var Previous Month
--July	   445	     1.86%	
--August	  1529	     6.40%	                   243.82%
--September     638	     2.67%	                  -58.24%

-- How many donors have also taken an advocacy action? 
-- And we also want to know what is the proportion of donors that took advocacy action over the total. 

SELECT 
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN advocacycount > 0 THEN organizationmemberid END) AS Member_Advocacy_Action,
  
    ROUND(COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN advocacycount > 0 THEN organizationmemberid END) * 100.0 
    / COUNT(DISTINCT organizationmemberid), 2) AS Proportion_of_Total
FROM subscribers 

--The total members that also took an advocacy action were 11,340. This represents a 47.46%



--5. Also we visualize the Total amount donated for each month, the everage of the donations, and the proportion of 
--the total of the 3 months that we are analizing. 

SELECT 
  CASE
    WHEN paymentdate LIKE '7%' THEN 1
    WHEN paymentdate LIKE '8%' THEN 2
    WHEN paymentdate LIKE '9%' THEN 3
  END AS '#',
  CASE
    WHEN paymentdate LIKE '7%' THEN 'July'
    WHEN paymentdate LIKE '8%' THEN 'August'
    WHEN paymentdate LIKE '9%' THEN 'September'
  END AS month,
  SUM(paymentamount) AS Total_Amount_Donated,
  ROUND(AVG(paymentamount),2) AS Average_Amount_Donated,
  ROUND(SUM(paymentamount) * 100.0 / (SELECT SUM(paymentamount) FROM donations WHERE paymentdate BETWEEN '7/1/2018' AND '9/30/2018'), 2) AS Proportion_of_Total_Amount
FROM donations
GROUP BY month

UNION ALL -- To generate the totals in the last row
SELECT 
  4 AS '#', 
 'Total' AS month,
  SUM(paymentamount) AS Total_Amount_Donated,
  ROUND(AVG(paymentamount),2) AS Average_Amount_Donated,
  100.0 AS Proportion_of_Total_Amount  
FROM donations
WHERE paymentdate BETWEEN '7/1/2018' AND '9/30/2018'
ORDER BY "#";

--The analysis of donation data reveals interesting insights regarding the donation amounts, averages, 
--and proportions for each month. Here are the findings:

--July: The total donation amount for July was $18,345, with an average donation amount of $41.22. 
--These donations constituted approximately 17.4% of the total donations.

--August: August recorded the highest donation amount, reaching $56,283, accounting for around 53.39%
--of the total donations. The average donation amount for this month was $36.79.

--September: Although September had a lower total donation amount of $33,368, the average donation 
--amount per donation was significantly higher at $52.22. Donations in September represented 
--approximately 31.65% of the total.

--These insights highlight the varying donation patterns and can provide valuable information 
--for understanding donor behavior and planning future fundraising efforts.

--The table below summarizes the results:

--Month	Donation Amount    Average Donation    Percentage of Total
--July            $18,345	        $41.22	    17.4%
--August          $56,283	        $36.79	    53.39%
--September       $33,368	        $52.22	    31.65%
--Total	    $105,414	        $41.90	    100%
