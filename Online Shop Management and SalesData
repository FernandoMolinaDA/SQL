-- This is a SQL data analysis project using the Chinook database. The project includes queries to explore the data, 
-- such as finding the average, maximum, and minimum total sales, the number of customers for each country, and the total sales 
-- amount per year for each country. The project also includes queries related to the employees of the company, such as showing 
-- the invoices and clients associated with each sales agent and the total sales by year and country. 
-- If you have any question, please contact me to fmolina.da@gmail.com
 


-- First I run some queries to make an initial exploration of the data. The data base is 

SELECT * FROM chinook.invoices

SELECT AVG(TOTAL)
, MAX(TOTAL)
, MIN (TOTAL)
FROM chinook.invoices

SELECT DISTINCT * FROM chinook.invoices

SELECT DISTINCT BillingCity FROM chinook.invoices 
   WHERE BillingCountry = "USA"
   
SELECT * FROM chinook.albums

SELECT * FROM chinook.customers

-- Then I ran a query to show the customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) 
-- who are not in the US. 

SELECT FirstName
, LastName
, CustomerId
, Country 
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country != "USA"

-- Then I ran a query to show the number of customers for each country. 

SELECT Country 
,COUNT(CustomerID) 
FROM chinook.customers
Group by Country
Order by COUNT(CustomerID) DESC

-- Then I ran a query to show the number of Sales, Total Sales Amount, and Average Sales for each country. 

SELECT BillingCountry
, COUNT(InvoiceId) AS No_of_Sales
, SUM(Total) AS Total_Sales
, AVG(Total) AS Average_Sale
FROM chinook.invoices
Group by BillingCountry
Order by SUM(Total) desc


-- Then I ran a query to show the Total Sales Amount per year for each country. 

SELECT BillingCountry
, strftime('%Y', InvoiceDate) AS Year
, SUM(Total) AS Total_Sales
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE strftime('%Y', InvoiceDate) BETWEEN '2009' AND '2013'
GROUP BY BillingCountry, Year
ORDER BY BillingCountry, Year

-- Then I ran a query to find the invoices of customers who are from Brazil. 
-- The resulting table includes the customer`s full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.

SELECT cust.FirstName || ' ' || cust.LastName AS Customer_Name, inv.InvoiceId, inv.InvoiceDate, inv.BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices inv
JOIN chinook.customers cust ON inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId
WHERE cust.Country = 'Brazil'
ORDER BY (inv.invoicedate)

-- In the next queries I will explore more information related to the employees of the company and their performance.

-- First, I ran a query including all the employees, their title and who they report to, and their country. This provides information of
-- is in Sales, IT, and who the manager is. Also knowing that all of the staff is located in Canada

SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName || ' ' || LastName AS Employee_Name, Title, ReportsTo, Country
FROM chinook.employees
ORDER BY ReportsTo asc

-- Then, I ran a query that shows the invoices and clients associated with each sales agent. 

SELECT e.FirstName || ' ' || e.LastName AS Employee_Name
, COUNT(DISTINCT c.CustomerId) AS Customer_Count
, COUNT(DISTINCT i.InvoiceId) AS Invoice_Count
FROM chinook.employees e
LEFT JOIN chinook.customers c ON e.EmployeeId = c.SupportRepId
LEFT JOIN chinook.invoices i ON c.CustomerId = i.CustomerId
GROUP BY Employee_Name
HAVING Customer_Count>0

--Then, I wanted to show the total sales by year, creating a query 
-- that shows the total invoices and total sales. 

SELECT emp.FirstName || ' ' || emp.LastName AS Employee_Name
, strftime('%Y', inv.InvoiceDate) AS Year
, COUNT(DISTINCT inv.InvoiceId) AS Total_Invoices
, SUM(inv.Total) AS Total_Sales
FROM chinook.employees emp
LEFT JOIN chinook.customers cust ON emp.EmployeeId = cust.SupportRepId
LEFT JOIN chinook.invoices inv ON cust.CustomerId = inv.CustomerId
WHERE emp.Title = 'Sales Support Agent'
GROUP BY Employee_Name, Year
ORDER BY Employee_Name, Year

--Then, I wanted to show the total sales by year and country. 

SELECT strftime('%Y', i.InvoiceDate) AS Year
, i.BillingCountry
, SUM(i.Total) AS Total_Sales
FROM chinook.invoices i
GROUP BY Year, i.BillingCountry
ORDER BY i.BillingCountry, Year

--In the next queries I rank the Top 20 tracks by Total Sales and the number of times the track was sold
SELECT trk.name
, COUNT(inv.InvoiceID) AS No_of_Sales
, SUM(inv.Total) AS Total_Sales
FROM chinook.invoices inv
JOIN chinook.invoice_items ite 
ON inv.InvoiceId=ite.InvoiceId
JOIN chinook.tracks trk
ON trk.TrackId=ite.TrackId
GROUP BY trk.name
ORDER BY Total_Sales desc
Limit 20

----Then, I ran a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.
SELECT trk.name AS Track
, art.name AS Artist
, alb.title AS Album
, gnr.name AS Genre
FROM chinook.tracks trk
JOIN chinook.albums alb ON trk.AlbumId=alb.AlbumId
JOIN chinook.artists art ON art.ArtistId=alb.ArtistId
JOIN chinook.genres gnr ON trk.GenreId=gnr.GenreId

----Then, I ran a query to show the Total Sales just for the "Rock" songs and see those sales for each year. 

SELECT gnr.Name AS Genre
, strftime('%Y', inv.InvoiceDate) AS Year
, SUM(inv.Total) AS Total_Sales
FROM chinook.invoices inv
JOIN chinook.invoice_items ite ON inv.InvoiceId = ite.InvoiceId
JOIN chinook.tracks trk ON ite.TrackId = trk.TrackId
JOIN chinook.genres gnr ON trk.GenreId = gnr.GenreId
WHERE strftime('%Y', inv.InvoiceDate) BETWEEN '2009' AND '2013'
      AND gnr.Name="Rock"
